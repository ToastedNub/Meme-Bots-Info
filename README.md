# Meme-Bots-Info

I am building a meme archive, you can request gifs, videos, and images to be added to the bots!

 - REQUESTS
 - You request using a command: !SEND your_link_here
 - To get a media link, right click the image, gif, or video, and click "copy link", this is the link you put in the command!
 - These links get manually verified before being added to the bots, to keep it at least somewhat clean!


 - You can invite the bots [here!](https://discord.gg/BYFmPrMgAs)

 - These are the [links](https://github.com/ToastedNub/LogMessages) the bots are able to send!
